# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh






MERN Stack Authentication
Project Overview
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates user authentication using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The app includes:

Registration Page: New users can sign up by providing their details.
Login Page: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
Home Page: After successful login, users are redirected to the home page, where they can access protected content.
Authentication: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
